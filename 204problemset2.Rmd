1. What is the aggregate daily demand curve for gasoline in France? What is the supply curve for gasoline? What is the “benefit” to consumers under the status quo? What is the “benefit” to producers under the status quo? What is the environmental cost under the status quo?

```{r}
#need to find: high demand curve, low demand curve, aggregate demand curve, supply curve (mpc), environmental cost curve (mec), 

#high demand curve:

d_high <- lm(price ~ q_high, data = gasdata)
summary(d_high)
#p=a(q)+b
#p= -0.0001297(q) + 23.39

#saving output numbers for use later
a_high <- d_high$coefficients[2]
b_high <- d_high$coefficients[1]


#low demand curve:

d_low <- lm(price ~ q_low, data = gasdata)
summary(d_low)
#p=a(q)+b
#p= -0.0001355(q) + 21.99

#saving output numbers for use later
a_low <- d_low$coefficients[2]
b_low <- d_low$coefficients[1]




#need to know what q equals when p is 21.99085 for aggregate demand curve




#supply curve (mpc)
#p

```
